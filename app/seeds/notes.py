Add any additional flour as needed (I've found that sometimes I need as much as an additional ⅓ cup), stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl (see video above recipe for visual cue).

        Note(name="Baked Salmon with Lemon and Dill", content='''<p>Get ready to savor the succulent flavors of Baked Salmon with Zesty Lemon and Fresh Dill. This dish combines the natural richness of salmon with the bright and invigorating notes of lemon and dill.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Ingredients (Serves 4):</span></p><ul><li>4 salmon fillets</li><li>2 lemons</li><li>2 tablespoons of freshly chopped dill</li><li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li></ul><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</span></p><p>Before we dive into the delightful creation, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) to ensure the perfect cooking temperature. Meanwhile, rinse the salmon fillets under cold water, and gently pat them dry using a paper towel. This step helps to remove any excess moisture, allowing the salmon to bake evenly.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 2: Lay the Foundation</span></p><p>Place the salmon fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. This not only prevents sticking but also makes cleanup a breeze. Now, let the magic unfold as we infuse the salmon with the flavors that will elevate it to new heights!</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 3: The Harmonious Trio</span></p><p>Drizzle two tablespoons of olive oil over the salmon fillets, ensuring each piece is coated lovingly. Now, it's time for the zingy lemon to make its appearance. Squeeze the juice of one lemon generously over the salmon, reserving a few lemon slices for a picturesque garnish. The acidity of the lemon will add brightness and balance to the dish.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 4: Sprinkle the Finishing Touch </span></p><p>Ah, the fresh and aromatic dill! Sprinkle two tablespoons of freshly chopped dill over the salmon fillets, like a fragrant confetti of flavor. The dill's distinct herbal notes will dance beautifully alongside the salmon, infusing every bite with a touch of elegance. And don't forget to season with salt and pepper to enhance the savory undertones.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 5: A Lemon-Scented Embrace</span></p><p>Lay a few lemon slices on top of each salmon fillet, as if they were whispering their citrusy secrets. This step not only adds visual appeal but also imparts an additional burst of lemony goodness to each bite. It's a lovely touch that will leave your guests in awe.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 6: The Enveloping Seal</span></p><p>Gently fold up the edges of the parchment paper or aluminum foil, enveloping the salmon like a present waiting to be opened. This creates a sealed packet that will lock in the moisture and flavors, ensuring the salmon bakes to perfection.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 7: The Journey to Culinary Bliss</span></p><p>Place the bundled salmon in the preheated oven and let it work its magic. Allow it to bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. As it bakes, the tantalizing aromas of lemon and dill will fill your kitchen, building anticipation for the feast ahead.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 8: Unveiling the Treasure</span></p><p>Once the salmon has emerged from its cozy packet, be careful as you unwrap it, as the steam inside can be hot. The moment you've been waiting for has arrived! Admire the flaky and succulent salmon that glistens with the essence of lemon and dill.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="ql-size-large">Step 9: Presentation and Enjoyment</span></p><p>Arrange the salmon fillets on a platter and enjoy!</p>''', public=False, user_id=1, notebook_id=1),
